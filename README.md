# LiveKit to FFmpeg Forwarder

A simple tool to forward LiveKit streams to FFmpeg for processing or output. This application connects to a LiveKit WebSocket server and forwards the stream to FFmpeg with customizable output arguments.

## Installation

You can download the latest prebuilt binary release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/gilliginsisland/livekit-ffmpeg/releases/latest). Choose the appropriate binary for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux), download it, and place it in a directory included in your system's PATH.

Alternatively, if you prefer to build from source, ensure you have Go installed on your system and run:

```bash
go install github.com/gilliginsisland/livekit-ffmpeg@latest
```

## Usage

The application requires two mandatory flags to connect to the LiveKit server:

- `--url`: The URL of the LiveKit WebSocket server.
- `--token`: The user token generated by the LiveKit API for authentication.

After these flags, you can pass `--` followed by any FFmpeg output arguments to customize the stream processing (e.g., `-c copy` to output the codec as is).

### Example Command

```bash
livekit-ffmpeg --url ws://your-livekit-server:7880 --token your-api-token -- -c copy output.mp4
```

In this example:
- The tool connects to the LiveKit server at `ws://your-livekit-server:7880` with the provided token.
- The stream is forwarded to FFmpeg with the arguments `-c copy output.mp4`, which copies the codec without re-encoding and saves the output to `output.mp4`.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this tool is to bridge LiveKit streams to FFmpeg, allowing users to leverage FFmpeg's powerful processing capabilities for tasks like recording, transcoding, or streaming to other platforms.
